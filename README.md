Proposal
--------
From a suggested list of options each developer must select a topic to go in depth and create 30 minutes talk distributed as follows. 

* 15 minutes talk
* 15 minutes demo

The idea is to create a public available **knowledge base** with the talks and demos created to be used as internal reference.

Other objective is to do an assessment of the skills and evaluate how the developer face the challenge of dealing with new techonologies.


Demo Details
----
The talk and the code for the demo must be hosted on github in a public repository with its respective README file including a brief description of the talk and the neccessary information to run the demo. The code must be extensively documented.

The demo must contain a README file with the neccessary intructions and requirements to be executed

Also, is suggested to use the following structure 

* **src** - contains the documented source code for the demo
* **bin** - contains the generated or processed (minified, concatenated, linted, etc..) files by a grunt process)
* **REAME.md or README.markdown**
* **package.json** - in case of needing node dependencies
* **Gruntfile.js** - in case of using grunt
